    <string name="description">Hello and thank you for checking out Latinary. Latinary is a demo application I designed specifically for my developer profile and thus its core functionality is purposely limited.
        The app showcases thread-safe background data download via web request, data parsing, search functionality, text-to-speech capability, as well as UI customization.
        Additionally the app is designed to easily be updated to display data from any key/value styled text file with little code change. If you would like to contact me, you can reach out to me on LinkedIn via the button below. </string>
